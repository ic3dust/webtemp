1) If you have website blocked due to the CORS policy: "Cross 
	origin requests are only supported for protocol schemes: 
	chrome, chrome-extension, chrome-untrusted, data, http, https, isolated-app", 
	deal with it in Visual Studio. You have to keep live server extension at your disposal.
	Open the main html doc(it is not index.html, but "ama_html_senior.html" by now, 17.11.24) with live server.
	Now it is OK.
